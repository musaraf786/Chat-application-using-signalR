speech recognition chat application using signalR ASP.NET Project


Speech recognition is advancing rapidly in browsers and it has so many applications. In this project, you can see how speech recognition can be applied to a simple chat application. 
Instead of typing chat messages, we can just talk and our speech will be recognized by the browser.
